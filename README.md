# Neural Network Implementations

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of popular neural network architectures by reimplementing them from their original research papers. This approach ensures a deep grasp of both the high-level concepts and the core mathematical operations underlying these models.

## Why This Project?

This project was built to bridge the gap between theoretical research in neural networks and practical implementation. By reimplementing these networks from scratch and using TensorFlow, I aim to provide a clear pathway from understanding the fundamental principles to applying these networks to real-world problems.

## Problem Solved

The project addresses the challenge of understanding and implementing complex neural network architectures. It serves as an educational resource for those who wish to learn about the detailed workings of popular neural networks, offering a hands-on approach to grasping the intricacies of these models.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I have learned:

- The detailed workings of various neural network architectures.
- How to translate theoretical research papers into practical implementations.
- The differences between high-level implementation (using TensorFlow) and low-level, from-scratch implementation (using NumPy).
- Practical applications of these networks on real-world datasets, showcasing their capabilities.

## What Makes This Project Stand Out

- Comprehensive Approach: Each network is implemented twice—once using TensorFlow for efficiency and then from scratch using NumPy to understand the core mathematical operations.
- Real-World Applications: Demonstrates the practical utility of the networks by applying them to real-world datasets.
- Educational Resource: Includes blogs that detail the challenges faced and the thought process behind implementing each network, providing a valuable learning resource.

## Current Implementations
