Welcome to my Neural Network Implementations repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of popular neural network architectures by reimplementing them from their original research papers. The implementations are done in two stages: first using TensorFlow for a higher-level, efficient approach, and then from scratch using NumPy to grasp the core mathematical operations behind the networks.

Current Implementations:

1. LeNet-5 (Tensorflow only)
Paper: Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition by Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner.
